# Sentiment Analysis of News Articles by Publisher

This Jupyter Notebook analyzes the sentiment distribution of news articles by publisher. The goal is to identify dominant publishers and categorize the sentiments of their articles into positive, negative, or neutral.

## Overview

The notebook performs the following steps:

1. **Calculate Publisher Statistics**: Identify the number and percentage of articles published by each publisher.
2. **Identify Dominant Publishers**: Filter publishers who have contributed to more than 10% of the total articles.
3. **Sentiment Categorization**: Classify each article's sentiment as positive, negative, or neutral based on a numerical `sentiment` score.
4. **Sentiment Distribution by Publisher**: Calculate and display the distribution of sentiment categories for each dominant publisher.

## Key Functions

- **Publisher Statistics**: Uses `value_counts()` to count articles per publisher and compute their percentage of the total articles.
- **Sentiment Classification**: Utilizes a lambda function to categorize each article's sentiment score into positive, negative, or neutral.
- **Sentiment Distribution**: Aggregates sentiment counts for each dominant publisher and displays the results.

## Example Output

The notebook outputs the dominant publishers along with the distribution of sentiments for their articles. An example of the output format:
